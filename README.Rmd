<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of {fmr} is to:

* Establish R-connection to Fisheries Technology Management (FTM) Oracle database
* Provide convenient functions to FTM tables and views
* Provide Rmarkdown report templates for various standardized reports
* R-code examples for data analysis and graphical presentations

## Quick start

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("einarhjorleifsson/fmr")
```


```{r}
library(fmr)
library(tidyverse)
key <- "your FM API key"
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
key <- Sys.getenv("fm_key")
```

```{r}
fm_survey(key) |> glimpse()
```

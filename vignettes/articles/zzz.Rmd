```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  message = FALSE,
  warning = FALSE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

To establish a connection in R one needs to do this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
               Driver = "Oracle",
               Port = 1521,
               UID = username,
               PWD = password,
               DBQ = DBQ,
               timeout = 20)
```

Now, the username and password should of course never be revealed.

But question is if ok to provide a text path for the FTM DBQ inside af function that will reside on github.com?

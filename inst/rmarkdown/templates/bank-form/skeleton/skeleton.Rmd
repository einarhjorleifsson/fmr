**Subject**: Request for Loan Consideration for Name of Vessel Fishing Operation.




Dear Sir/Madam



I write one behalf of `r params$OPERATOR`, a dedicated and hardworking fisher who operates the fishing vessel named `r unique(d$vessel)`. `r params$OPERATOR` has been an integral part of the fishing community, contributing significantly to the local economy through sustainable fishing practices.


Enclosed, please find a summary table detailing recent fishing activities  for the period `r params$PERIOD_FROM` to  `r params$PERIOD_TO`:



```{r}
d |> 
  left_join(fmr::fm_catch(key)) |> 
  mutate(Year = year(arr_time),
         `Week number`  = week(arr_time)) |> 
  group_by(Year, `Week number`) |> 
  dplyr::reframe(`Number of trips` = n_distinct(trip_id),
                 `Catch [lb]` = sum(weight)) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```


Thank you for considering this request. We look forward to the possibility of working together to support `r params$OPERATOR` and his crew in continuing their valuable contribution to the fishing community.

Yours faithfully 




Randel Thompson

Director

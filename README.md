  Manager](https://fimsehf.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FT/overview?homepageId=3175186440)
  data provided by [Fisheries Technologies](https://fishtech.is)
  - The current communication is via APIâ€™s that provides data in
    json-format
- Provide wrapper functions to FTM tables and views
- Provide markdown report templates for various standardized reports
- R-code examples for data analysis and graphical presentations
